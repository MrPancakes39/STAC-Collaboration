# STAC-Collaboration
This is a repository for a team collaboration on a competition called "Save the Teen Mobile App Competition".
This is a private development, you have no right to copy, modify or use it in anyway, unless given permission to.

I will be using [Processing](https://processing.org/), an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE), to develop this mobile application.

Credit to [Tom-Kab](https://github.com/Tom-Kab) for helping with the design of the app. The designs are stored in the res folder.
